# metalsmith-multi-language

## Instalation

    $ npm install --save metalsmith-multi-language

## Usage

Add the plugin:

```javascript
var multiLanguage = require('metalsmith-multi-language');

Metalsmith(__dirname)
    .use(multiLanguage({ default: 'es', locales: ['en', 'es'] }))
```

The plugin needs both a `default` locale and the supported `locales` list. Note that `default` repeats in the `locales` array. `default` will act as the **main** locale while the others will be the **secondary** ones.

Append the locale to your file names (`_{locale}` with the underscore), e.g.:

```
index_es.md
index_en.md
path/file_es.md
path/file_en.md
```

Or put your files in locale-specific directories, e.g.:

```
path/es/file.md
path/en/file.md
path/es/subdir/file.md
path/en/subdir/file.md
```

Note that **this plugin does not handle URL generation**, if you need URLs in the `:locale/:slug` format or similar check [`metalsmith-permalinks`](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-permalinks).

### Property merging

The plugin will merge properties from the **main** locale to the **secondary** ones. This is usefull if you want a property shared between all the locales (e.g.: `date`, `template`â€¦).

### `locale` property

Each file will have a `locale` property with its locale, if the filename does not have the locale extension the **main** locale will be set, e.g.: `file_en.md` `locale` property would be `en`, while for `rand.md` will be `es`.

### `lang()` method

Each file will have a `lang()` method which is usefull to reference the translated files. So, if you're in the `index_es.md` file, and you want to get the english version just call `lang('en')`.

If the locale is not found this will throw an expection.

### `defaultLocale` & `locales`

Both options will be added to Metalsmith metadata as: `defaultLocale` and `locales` so that you can use them in your templates.

### Index handling

The plugin will handle the index files gracefully, so that, if `es` is the **main** locale and `en` is the **secondary** one. This:

```
index_es.md
index_en.md
```

Becomes:

```
index.md
en/index.md
```

The plugin will also add a `path` property to each index file with the pretty path, e.g.: `''` (empty string) for `index.md` and `en/` for `en/index.md`.

## Tests

`npm test` to run the tests.
